I. Introduction

In today's fast-paced digital world, managing personal finances effectively has become increasingly challenging. Traditional banking apps often lack comprehensive features for holistic financial management, leading to fragmented financial tracking and suboptimal decision-making. This paper introduces Wall8, a sophisticated web application designed to bridge this gap by providing users with a unified platform for managing their finances. The app leverages modern web technologies and artificial intelligence to offer personalized insights, automated transaction categorization, and comprehensive budget tracking capabilities.

II. OBJECTIVE

The primary objective of this research paper is to develop and evaluate a modern web application that revolutionizes personal financial management. The application aims to address common challenges in expense tracking and budget management while providing intelligent insights for better financial decision-making. Key features include:
- Multi-account management with real-time balance tracking
- AI-powered transaction categorization and insights
- Comprehensive budget monitoring and alerts
- Interactive dashboard with financial analytics
- Secure authentication and data protection
Additionally, the application implements best practices in modern web development, ensuring scalability, performance, and security.

III. Literature Survey

Our development approach began with a comprehensive analysis of existing financial management solutions and modern web development practices. We studied platforms such as:
